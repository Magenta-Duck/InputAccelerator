# Input Accelerator

A chrome extension that accelerates user input on specific pages by using methods like auto-selecting fields, splitting drop-downs into split buttons, adding keyboard shortcuts, and more.

The primary use case is to accelerate valuing, triarging, and listing donated items for sale in a charity shop environment on a large scale, but it is of course suitable for many other use cases.

## Current Status

**Specification**.  The inital project requirements have been completed and we are now turning those into a specification.  The project will be specified in discrete manageable phases, with an eye on the future requirements.
